# Grok Build for macOS

Apple Silicon macOS build of [xAI Grok Build](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build)
with its interactive permission and folder-trust gates removed.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/celados/grok-build.git
cd grok-build
./install.sh
```

`~/.grok/bin` must be on `PATH`.

## Update

```sh
grok update
```

The binary uses this repository's GitHub Releases as its only update channel.

## Build locally

```sh
brew install ast-grep dotslash
./build.sh --version 1.0.0 --install
```

`build.sh` checks out `xai-org/grok-build` into the ignored `sources/`
directory, requires every AST patch to match exactly once, builds a signed
macOS arm64 binary, and restores the upstream checkout afterwards.

## Release policy

The scheduled GitHub Action checks `upstream/main` once daily. A changed
upstream SHA produces one new custom release; an unchanged SHA exits without
building. The version-to-upstream mapping is recorded in
[versions.jsonl](versions.jsonl).

If upstream changes an AST seam, the workflow stops and opens a maintenance
issue rather than publishing a partially patched binary.
