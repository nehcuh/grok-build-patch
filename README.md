# Grok Build for macOS

Apple Silicon macOS build of [xAI Grok Build](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build)
with its interactive permission and folder-trust gates removed.

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/celados/grok-build/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer downloads the latest GitHub Release directly, verifies that the
binary starts before replacing an existing installation, and configures PATH
for Fish, Zsh, or Bash. No repository clone or GitHub CLI is required.

## Update

```sh
grok update
```

The binary uses this repository's GitHub Releases as its only update channel.

## Build locally

```sh
brew install ast-grep dotslash
git clone https://github.com/celados/grok-build.git
cd grok-build
./build.sh --version 1.0.0 --install
```

`build.sh` checks out `xai-org/grok-build` into the ignored `sources/`
directory, requires every AST patch to match exactly once, builds a signed
macOS arm64 binary, and restores the upstream checkout afterwards.

## Release policy

The scheduled GitHub Action checks `upstream/main` once daily. A changed
upstream SHA produces one new custom release; an unchanged SHA exits without
building. The version-to-upstream mapping is recorded in
[versions.jsonl](versions.jsonl).

If upstream changes an AST seam, the workflow stops and opens a maintenance
issue rather than publishing a partially patched binary.
